# SVM-vs-OtherClassifiers
I had compared Support Vector Machine with other Linear and Non Linear Classifier and shown how great it is on non linear dataset like circles and moons.<br>
All visualizations are also shown including 3d. For better 3d Representation please run it on ide rather than jupyter as a .py file.<br>
## Requirements
- Scipy/SKlearn
- Numpy
